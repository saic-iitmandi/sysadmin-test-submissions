## Challenge 1 - Gain Access to a Remote Server

Since you will be in charge of a public-facing server you need to know how to protect a server and to protect a server you must first learn how attacks generally work. A drive link containing a saic.ova file is provided to you. This file can be imported into a Virtual Box. When run as a guest, it will act as a remote server hosting a site on it's own local host which can be seen on your host's localhost. You have to get inside this server by exploiting any vulnerability that you find.

Report your findings and method. You will find the flag once you have gained root privileges.

Use of tools like metasploit is discouraged.

Drive link for the Virtual Machine: [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18gYRoKNzUAefeh4g1U-7L54IBe2h6Wn2/view)

#### Deliverables

In your git repository whose link you will be submitting, state your approach for finding the flag along with screenshots of the process.

## Challenge 2 - Docker Monitoring & Scripting

[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) is one of the most widely used services to _containerize_ applications that must run on the same host system but in independent environments. We also use Docker containers on the SNTC server to deploy each of the clubs' websites simultaneously running on the same hardware. However in case the main program running inside a container exits, the container will also abruptly shut down with it.

Your challenge is to monitor all the Docker containers running on a host system, and identify if a container exits or changes state from normal/running/active. Additionally, your program should then automatically alert us by sending an email to saic@students.iitmandi.ac.in with helpful info such as _Which container? / what program was running inside it? When?_ Optionally even _How did it stop - any error code or traceback?_ etc...<br>

**Send the email with the subject "Sysadmin test 2023 - Challenge 2"**

<br><br>

(**If you are going to test the script a few times, please don't spam this email ID (or anyone else). You can use another personal ID for the test recipient.**)

<summary>Notes on Docker [expand]</summary>

If you have never heard anything about how docker works before, here are 3 questions that may help guide you - <ul>

<li>What is an <i>Image</i> vs. <i>Container</i> ?</li>

<li>Virtual Environment (e.g. Python's venv or anaconda) <i>vs.</i> Container (Docker etc..) <i>vs.</i> a Virtual Machine (Oracle VBox, etc...)</li>

<li>What is a <code>Dockerfile</code> ?</li>

</ul>

<p>We aren't asking you to deploy any specific service/container in this problem. You can create your own Docker images of any kind, or even just pull some from the <a  href="https://hub.docker.com/search?q=">Docker Hub</a> and run those. Maybe you insert a script that automatically exits after some time, or you can stop the container manually during testing to check if your monitoring script works.</p>

<summary>Notes on Emailing [expand]</summary>

You will likely need credentials of a <i>trusted</i> SMTP server/relay to send email that will actually be accepted and downloaded to any inbox. You may use any service that is publicly available. There are free accounts on some mailing services that are feasible to create, or even Gmail allows you to use its SMTP relay, with some conditions. <b>Please do not allow your credentials to be leaked or appear in the code at any time, as you will need to make your Git repository public later! They can then be misused by anyone on the internet.</b> You can record a short video of the email script working and being received in your inbox so that we can see the script in action, or, instead document how to provide the credentials so that we can use our own and test it.

</details>

#### Deliverables

- Dockerfiles and relevant associated scripts or description for building the images.

- Email automation script(s)

- Main script(s) to detect changes

- Description of the scheduling/monitoring method you used

## Challenge 3 - Docker Deployments

You are given github repositories of two websites, both made using different technologies. Your task is to deploy both websites using docker containers which run on your localhost. You are free to choose any ports for mapping to your docker containers. You are required to set up docker containers using a docker compose script and perform the following tasks -

1. Backup a volume mapped data as a zip file to a folder of your choice everyday at 11:55 pm.

2. Suggest network types to use for each container and give justification for your choice of network.

The websites are provided here: [SAIC IIT Mandi](https://github.com/KamandPrompt/SAIC-Website), [Github Languages](https://github.com/alex-benoit/github-languages.git)

The technologies used in the different websites are based on HTML-CSS-JS and Ruby on Rails respectively.

#### Deliverables

1. Document the steps required to host both of the websites accompanied with relevant screenshots.

2. Attach the Dockerfiles, backup script and Docker Compose script

## Challenge 4 - Docker & Networking

In this challenge you have to perform/write scripts for the tasks below:<br>

1. Have you heard about **Docker Hub**?<br>

In this challenge, you have to first **automate docker image deployments** using the image id(s) on [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=).<br>

Then proceed to add the following functionalities.

2.  **Perform load balancing using multiple instances of the same docker image.**<br>

You can take the number of instances to be **3**. Bonus points for generalizing :)<br>

Load balancing must be such that when you locally request a particular domain/URL multiple times, the requests get distributed uniformly across the docker instances.<br>

Test this load balancing by sending multiple requests using curl or some other tool.<br>

You can either demonstrate it using docker-compose output or <br>

docker logs(`sudo docker logs <image name/id> -f`) or <br>

through access logs(`cat <log file path/location> -f`) (see below task)<br>

3.  **Design a custom log file architecture/format for all running docker instances which you feel is best suited for a single server**<br>

Demonstrate it locally using at least two docker instances.<br>

Why is your design preferable to the default one? Justify your answer with respect to both access and error logs.<br>

### [ To demonstrate and test your script(s) you must use [this image (lightweight)](https://hub.docker.com/r/metavinayak/matrix) or [this one (customizable)](https://hub.docker.com/r/metavinayak/matrix-custom) ]

#### Deliverables

- Dockerfiles or Docker Compose files

- Video/Screenshots of Load Balancing demonstration

- Video/Screenshot of custom logs demonstration and/or any other scripts used

## Challenge 5 - Scripting

Create a script to retrieve all the assignments which have submission deadlines in the future and don't have any submission till now. Your task is to send email reminders about any unsubmitted assignments 6hrs before the submission deadline. Mail should be sent to your email address for demonstration purpose. If there are any unsubmitted assignments past deadline, print the name of course and title of assignment.

Note:

- Avoid polling else you may get banned from lms.iitmandi.ac.in.

- To avoid spamming, pick one course and send email for just one assignment which is due, or was due in the past.

- You may use any language of your choice.

- Please replace any credentials and passwords with asterisks(\*) for your own security

Deliverables:

- Script to achieve the above.

- Approach as to how/why your solution works.

- (Optional but recommended) Video example/tutorial.
