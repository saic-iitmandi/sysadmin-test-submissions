* Script for checking the running/closed containers and etc.. is written in python.
* This scripts uses the libraries like docker,traceback, smtplib, MIMEText etc..
* If checkers do not have installed this libraries in their system please install it if you wanna check.
* Also I am not able to share the screenshots of working script because due to my system limitations docker engine fails to start and give me the error also I have added <br>screenshot of that error.
* But I am sure that this script will work. :smile:
