found a user saic and tried to find its password but no success

checked if sudo is available for guest or not

studied the permissions for files /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd which contains passwords for all users

also searched for kernal exploits in ubuntu 12.04 found some but didn't tried anything

then after a long searching found that guest session is configured by lightdm

searched on google for exploitaions in lightdm 

found it and also tried to exploit it by writing a script it but no success

# LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- everything in linux is a file including commands <br>
- privilege escalation techniques which include unnecessary permissions, kernel exploits, using sudo with shell escape sequences
