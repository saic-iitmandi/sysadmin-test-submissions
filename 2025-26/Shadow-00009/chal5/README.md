This was my attempt on the challenge 5 in Sysadmin 25-26

I Clicked the link given in the question and was redirected to the drive.

First i checked the activity on the drive but there was only the activity of uploading the photo.

Then I checked the image to see if there was anything written on it or any hints i could get but I couldn't find anything.

So the question was to be solved by Steganalysis.
I didn't really had any prior knowledge on this topic and the time was running short so i left the question.
I would definetly try to solve this question later.
