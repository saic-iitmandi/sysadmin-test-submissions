Setup Steps

1. Navigate to the project root directory:
   cd royalchess

2. Build the Docker images:
   docker compose build

3. Start the application:
   docker compose up

4. Verify that all services are running:
   docker ps

5. Access the application via the port exposed for the frontend service
   (as defined in docker-compose.yml).

Notes
- All dependencies are containerized; no local installations are required.
- Frontend, backend, and database services communicate over a Docker bridge network.
- Environment variables are injected via Docker Compose.
- Cookie-based session handling was configured to work correctly within Docker.
