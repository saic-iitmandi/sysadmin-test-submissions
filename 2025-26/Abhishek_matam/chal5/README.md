** I liked this question too because iIknow that there is a pattern, but i am not able to decode that**
# The way I approached
* After downloading the PNG file, I went into the terminal.
*  And tried exiftool, which is commonly used for PNG file things.
* There I saw a pattern that is repeating, and I tried to write a code that can change this into a flag, but I tried so many ways.
* I tried these codes from AI.
* I used so many types of approaches to decode using AI, and used so many Python code files to decode it, like,
* First, I made one thing, to make a copy of the text, which is printed, so I used commands which can move printed things into a file.
from there, used uqiue, to check number of words and there were some pairs and i thought that may be a clue and I used so code to decode it 
but i can't able to complete .



And I didn't read the 2nd, 3rd questions because i didn't understand the question. and I have given(wasted) so much time to 1st and 5th 
.
