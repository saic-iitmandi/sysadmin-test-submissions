# Step 1: Build the React app

FROM node:16 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy both package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json package-lock.json /app/

# Install dependencies based on package-lock.json
RUN npm ci  # 'npm ci' is more reliable for CI/CD as it uses package-lock.json

# Copy the rest of the source code
COPY . /app

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the React app using a lightweight web server
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the previous stage to the nginx container
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to the outside world
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
