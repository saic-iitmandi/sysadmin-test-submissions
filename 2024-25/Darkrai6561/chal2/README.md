So this question requires me to use docker scripts
....
Yeeah I don't know even a single thing about it, in fact it was the first time I even heard of it 
So back to do the thing I do decently
googling
I googled about docker it is an open source application that packages the websites and hosts them on your localhost by allocating parts of your hardware to it and then we can port forward our localhost for it to show on internet
So I just went to the tutorials of it that were by the docker itself
did some things
Didn't knew what I was doing
Like it was like just I copied some scripts and the website came up on my localhost
so I just kept reading and... it was complicated 
I used chatgpt to do things still it wasn't something I could even come to comprehend 
so guess thats all what I will do for these 3 docker questions because I don't have enough time for them as most of it was taken by question 1 and question 5
