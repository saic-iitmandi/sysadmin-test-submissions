# CHALLENGE 3
So this was the problem I tried really for the first time and also my first encounter with Docker. I watched few intro videos from few channels, like NetworkChuck. 
After that i went on with TIP first. 
I had to create a Dockerfile and Docker-compose.yml file. I searched internet for Dockerfiles samples for a next.js based projects and found just the perfect codes for 
both the files.
As always, nothing works the first time, at first.
There were two errors, first one I didn't understand and second one was that it detected a dependency cycle, so i had to make some corrections.
With the help of chatgpt i resolved the two errors above.
But that was not all, errors kept coming, I had to download nodejs on my laptop to check every step of code to see which one is causing trouble.
There was also one weird error, that running script is disabled on system so i had to temporarily bypass it with the help of chatgpt.
After that much debugging, it finally worked.

It used default bridge.
But the same didn't went with Nutrients file. Errors kept coming and this took most of my time. 
I tried everything i could but the last precompile statement never seemed to work due to something.
Even now the dockerfile which i am giving not sure that it would be correct.
