# Steps through which I created the program

## Step 1: **Learning Web Scraping through Selenium**

- This was the primary challenge I faced. I tried to "LLM" my way through the problem.
- But since I knew little to nothing about such libraries, I eventually gave up on that approach and started learning web scraping and sending requests.

## Step 2: **Understanding the website and finding the most optimal approach**

### Problem 1 - The Login

- The first task was to log in to the server, which was not a big issue. It was handled by simple `driver.find_element(By.NAME, "field_name")` statements.
- I cleared the fields, entered the credentials, and clicked on the login button.
- This reloads the page. Now that I have access to the booking URL, I can use that from now on.

### Problem 2 - Travel Date Field

- I struggled with this a lot, as my initial approach was to simply click on the field and enter the travel date. This worked fine for a few tries but eventually stopped working.
- Later, I decided to separate the date and the month and filter based on that. This is why my input follows the format `(dd month)`.
- _This approach works amazingly because it automatically filters bookable dates—if a date is unavailable, it won’t be found, saving me the trouble of handling special exceptions._

### Problem 3 - Route and Schedule Field

- After dealing with the Travel Date field, this wasn't as difficult, so I’m grouping these two together. A bit of HTML inspection helped in handling this.
- For the Schedule field, I had to explore further to find a way to filter all available times and select one.
- I discovered that all option titles contained `"AM"` in their string, regardless of whether they were for AM or PM, so I used this to my advantage.

### Problem 4 - Bus No Field

- Filtering this was quite challenging for me at this stage. I initially planned to display a list of available buses, but filtering them out proved tricky.
- Fortunately, the problem statement required me to hardcode the bus name, so it could run periodically at the scheduled time.
- Thus, I filtered the available options and selected only the bus I needed.

### Problem 5 - Selecting the Bus Seat

- I observed that all vehicles had a maximum of 30 seats and found a general pattern for their checkbox ID:  
  `checkbox{i}`  
  where `i` ranges from 1 to 30.
- From there, I checked for disabled seats and filtered them out.
- Finally, I clicked on "Save" to confirm my selection.

## Step 3: **Understanding Email Handling Through Python**

- Will not lie, GPT helped me with this as I had not learned it yet. I just learned enough for it to send me a mail after this task completes.
- It was a pleasure learning this, though.

## Step 4: **Dealing with Automation of the File**

- I had little experience here as well, but due to guilt of using GPT, I preferred to learn this and then complete the task.
- It took me a while to get a hang of it, starting by printing a sentence every minute to eventually including error handling.
- I have scheduled the script to run at the same time of the day as traveltime as it would be the exact time that the window opens meaning the booking      would happen  immediately

# Conclusion

- I did use ChatGPT to learn a lot of things required in this task as well as to debug a few mistakes I made.
- But honestly, I would love to thank the SAIC team for giving me this opportunity to learn something new.
