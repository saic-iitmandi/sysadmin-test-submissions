I downloaded the .OVA file and VirtualBox and imported it into VirtualBox. After initiating the process, I executed various terminal commands like "ipconfig" , "ip route show" , etc but got no success.Then i executed "ip a" that got a ip adresss.
When i searched from that , a login page opened asking for email and password. Then, I decided to manually search the system folders. During this search, I found a file in "www" folder containing a **username**, **password**, and **email**.But the combination was not right.
